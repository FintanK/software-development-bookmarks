# :books: :ledger: Software Development Notes and Bookmarks

Standing on the shoulders of giants..

This markdown file (which is most certainly a work in progress right now ) attempts to help me revise many of the topics that i've covered over the last 12 years in the area of computer science. It includes links to some of my favourite articles / resources as well as some short write ups of my own interpretations of many topics / concepts that i've encountered along the way.

A CSS preprocessor is a program that lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, however most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on.

#### SASS

#### LESS

#### Stylus

Stylus simplifies your CSS Syntax to an indented format with a lot of extra features!

- Optional colons
- Optional semi-colons

# State Management for Web Applications

Just like the server, the browser can have different types of states to manage...

- Server Response Data
- User information
- User Input
- UI State
- Router / location state

State Management Libraries

- Model our app state
- Update the state
- Read state values
- Monitor changs to the state

## The Redux Design Pattern / Architecture

The three principles of Redux.

- Single source of truth.
- State is read-only.
- Pure functions update the state

One of the biggest benefits of using state management is that the duplicate dependency injection of data services
can be moved out from the components to the state management library implementation.

In Universal (Server side rendered) Angular apps you can prepopulate the store on page load and avoid the many HTTP many requests needed for this logic with an SPA (Single Page Application).

Great developer tools including time travel debugging.

Easier testing of how data retrieved in the client application is used.

Because the state is read only, our components just have to **react** to state changes. Our components role when using state management is to subscribe to the store and respond appropriately.

#### Redux Core Concepts

###### Single state tree

A single state tree is a single Javascript object. It is composed / built up using reducers.

It has an initial state. When the application loads.

**An example state**

```
const state = {
    todos: []
};
```

###### Actions

Actions have two properties

- Type (usually a string, describing the action).
- Payload (this is optional)

These are dispatched by components in order to update the application state but do not update the state themselves. This gives us an "immutable update pattern" which basically means that we clearly define how data is updated in our client applications.

```
const action = {
    type: 'ADD_TO_DO',
    payload: {
      label: 'Go for a jog',
      complete: false
    }
};
```

###### Reducers

These are pure functions (taken from the functional programming methodology) that update the application state. Given the same input they will always have the same output. They don't modify any data outside of their functional scope. This output is typically an updated application state.

This is a pure function. It does not mutate any data outside of it's own scope.

```
function reducer(state, action) {
    switch(action.type) {
       case: 'ADD_TO_DO': {
        const todo = action.payload;
        const todos = [...state.todos, todo],
        return [ todos]; // Update the state and pass back
       }
    }  
    return state; // Return the passed state by default
}
```

This would result in the state being updated

```
const state = {
    todos: [
      { labelL 'Go for a jog', complete: false }
    ]
};
```

###### Store

- The state container. Injected into components that need it.
- Components use the store to dispatch events
- Components use the store to subscribe to state updates.
- Handles responsibility of invoking reducers.

###### One-way data flow.

![One way data flow in redux](http://www.mrscottmcallister.com/assets/img/redux-flow.png)

###### Immutability

"An immutable object is an object that cannot be modified after creation."

Why would we make an object immutable?

- Predictability
- Explicit State Changes
- Performance
- Mutation Tracking
- Undoing state changes

# Semantic Web Applications

The first reference to the term "Semantic Web" was made by Tim Berners Lee back in 2011 in this publication [Google Scholar Link](http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_url?url=https://kask.eti.pg.gda.pl/redmine/projects/sova/repository/revisions/master/entry/doc/Master%2520Thesis%2520(In%2520Polish)/materials/10.1.1.115.9584.pdf&hl=en&sa=X&scisig=AAGBfm2r1XqP0ka20GZUp7W6sZup22to4Q&nossl=1&oi=scholarr)

Wikipedia Article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web

**Personal Opinion**: I studied this topic as part of my university thesis. I personally believe that the outlined solutions proposed by the W3C however interesting will not be accomodated any time soon by the majority of websites. Because of the flexible nature of HTML, CSS and Javascript coding practices websites will not provide structured markup required for the interopability of websites in this manner. 

Content Management Systems,oding Frameworks by be able to incorporate these coding practices in the future and take the manual work of adding context to markup out of the developers workflow.

## Shadow DOM

Shadow DOM refers to the ability of the browser to include a subtree of DOM elements into the rendering of a document, but not into the main document DOM tree.

## Frameworks that use web components

Whilst these frameworks might not follow the official W3C outlines for web components they are the most popular frameworks and libraries that are recognised as using "web components" by the community today.

## Client Side Detection

#### Browser User Agent

- Check your browser user agent https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent
- Mozilla Developer Network - Browser detection using the user agent https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent

#### Polyfills

Polyfills allow older browsers to handle HTML, CSS and Javascript features that would typically not be available with your client side code.
    
## Server Side Detection

Server side detection is a very powerful technique that allows you to detect the users device, browser and browser capabilities before serving any content to their device. This allows you to customize the user experience and cater to any progresive functionality that their device and browser may support.

- Using supported HTML5 API
- Hardware capabilities
- Supported network protocols
- Video, audio
- JAVA
- Optimize the bandwidth used for the website when serving HTML, CSS, Javascript, Images, Fonts etc.

## Enterprise Angular applications with Nx (I highly recommended this)

Nx is brilliant. It is built on top of the Angular CLI so it will feel quite familiar to other developers hat have used it before. 

All of the existing Angular CLI commands will work but NX offers more functionality.

It allows you to manage your application with a more advanced CLI tool that automates more than the standard Angular CLI.

It provides a framework for Enterprise Angular development that avoids complications with managing shared libraries and avoiding
unecessary pipelines.

It also helps developers to see where they can avoid code duplication, increase modularity and avoid introducing breaking changes.

- Extra Code Generation
- Workspace Management
- NgRx State Management Code Generation
- Data Persistence Management
- Linters
- Code Formatting
- UpgradeModule and dowgradeModule helpers
- Vulnerability scanning

#### How Nx structures your Enterprise Angular Applications

```
<project-root-directory>
apps/
  website1.com/
    src/
  website2.com
    src/
libs/
  website1.com/
    src/
  website2.com/
    src/
  ui-component-library
    src/
  data-services
    src/
```

- You now don't need separate GIT repos!
- Our applications are independenly deployable!
- You can clearly see how your applications and shared node modules relate to each other!
- No more CI/CD Pipelines for every shared library we create!
- We can clearly see when things break for ANY application!
- No GIT submodules :)
- No cloning different GIT repos to see how a shared library works (easier to keep everything on context).

Each library has an index.ts fie so we can use shared modules in our repo as if they we normal NPM modules.
For example we won't need to do this

```
import { CustomModule } from '@ourorgansiation/custom/src/custom.module'
```

We can still do this..

```
import { CustomModule } from '@ourorgansiation/custom'
```

###### Creating custom Angular Schematics with NX

Angular schematics are a very interesting topic for me personally. Enterprise developers can use Angular Schematics to streamline code generation in projects. The Angular CLI comes when many code generation commands which is powerful for scaffolding applications. These in themselves are Angular Schematics and you can roll your own for your projects or enterprise workspaces. Add Nx to the mix and developers can automate much of their development workflow.

- Library generation
- Component generation
- Unit Test Generation

Whatever you want form your code structure really..

###### Benefits

- Enforcing design patterns
- Enforcing modularity of code
- Enforcing naming conventions

https://auth0.com/blog/create-custom-schematics-with-nx/

###### Final notes on NX

- Use the Angular console app (other developers can learn more quickly this way) https://angularconsole.com/

###### Reference Commands

A comprehensive list of commands can be found here https://github.com/nrwl/nx-examples (Highly recommended)

## State Management with NgRX for Angular.

NgRX at it's core is made up of NgRX Store and Effects. It utilizes the popular Rx.js library and it's observable design pattern to
provide a Redux architecture for state management in Angular.

- NgRX Store on Github https://github.com/ngrx/store
- NgRx Effects https://github.com/ngrx/effects
- NgRX best practice patterns https://angularcamp.org/files/State_Management_Patterns_and_Best%20Practices_with_NgRx.pdf

There are other libraries than can be used with NgRX but they are optional.

Note: Code scaffolding for NgRX can be achived with NX Angular Schemantics but it is important to understand how the Redux pattern and NgRX specifcally work with Angular.

#### What is NgRX Store?

Official documentation https://ngrx.io/guide/store

Inspired by the Redux architecture NgRX Store using RXJS Observables to provide state management in Angular.

###### Benefits of NgRX Store

- Single source of truth
- Testability
- Performance Benefits (one-way data flow. No unexpected events in your components around data management).
- Root and feature module support (eager ad laxy loaded modules).

###### Store selectors

This is probably the toughest part about NgRX in general but they are well worth implementing

A very basic component implementation interacting with the store would look something like this..

```
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store'
// other imports

export class YourCustomComponent implements OnInit {

   constructor(private store: Store<fromStore.ToDosState>) {
    
   }
   
   ngOnInit() {
    this.store.select<>('todos').subscribe() // etc
   }

};

```

You can however define functions in your store that care of all of the logic for navigating the state and getting the data your are looking for. These can be imported and used to select data specifically from your store. Your component can then store the observables and use asynch in your components to handle changes to the state reactively.

You can use a naming convention for observables that are stored on your component. Typically using the $ at the end of the variables name is a good idea.

```
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store'
// other imports

export class YourCustomComponent implements OnInit {

   todos$: Observable<ToDo[]>

   constructor(private store: Store<fromStore.ToDosState>) {
    
   }
   
   ngOnInit() {
    this.todos$ = this.store.select>(fromStore.getAllToDos)
   }

};

```

Then in your HTML for the component

```
<div *ngIf="!((todos$ | async)?.length)">
    These are currently no to do items
</div>
<to-do-item *ngFor="let todo of (todos$ | async)" [todo]="todo"></to-do-item>
```

This observables and async approach makes your components implement a reactive architecture.

#### What are NgRX Effects?

Official doccuentation https://ngrx.io/guide/effects

- Listen for ngrx/store actions that are dispatched
- Isolate side effects from components
- Communicate outside of Angular (Handle API calls, websockets etc)

![NgRX Effects Flow](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vSadxKWVoAirhVCa8fxiNw.png)

Because reducers are pure functions these are not ideal places to put API calls

If an effect fetches data from an external source then it will dispatch an action of it's own with a reducer handling it and updating the state

Effects don't perform service calls themselves. They will typically offload that work to an Angular service.

#### NgRX Facades

This pattern is purely optional but once implemented provides a much cleaner implementation with NgRX on the component level.

I haven't used this approach myself yet but would like to. I'm curious about how it effects testing.

Its also supported by Nx Angular Schematics!

https://medium.com/@thomasburleson_11450/ngrx-facades-better-state-management-82a04b9a1e39

#### NgRX Entities

A great tutorial https://blog.angular-university.io/ngrx-entity/#operationssupportedbythengrxentityadapter

Can be used with NgRX Schematics and provides..

- Entity State adapter for managing record collections by ID reference.
- Entity provides an API to manipulate and query entity collections.
- Reduces boilerplate for creating reducers that manage a collection of models.
- Provides performant CRUD operations for managing entity collections.
- Extensible type-safe adapters for selecting entity information.

#### Redux Dev Tools - Highly recommended

This will allow you see every single action and state change in your app. 

It really showcases how reactive your application is when built using the redux pattern.

You can also step back in time to an older state to debug issues with your application by dragging the slider.

It will also visualize your state tree in an easy to understand way if you index your data with the entities approach outlined above.

You can download the extension here http://extension.remotedev.io/

#### Setting up NgRX Router Store

This allows us to integrate our router state to the redux store in our application which is quite useful for even more debugging with
our dev tools. It also makes our application more reactive.

** I will be providing a link here to my own reference Angular application with state management **

#### My own lessons from implementing state management with NgRX

- State Management with Angular requires a lot of extra code. This can be generated automatically though with the CLI once NgRX schematics have been added to your project https://ngrx.io/guide/schematics . It's even better using NX https://nrwl.io/nx/guide-setting-up-ngrx
- Implement container components for each feature (these are basically the top most parent components for each module).
- Hook up your router to the state
- Make both your routing and store actions resource based (from the API down to the store for consistency, bespoke functionality can be implemented at the component level).
- Keep your stores inside of the relevant modules only. This will allow you to keep your feature implementations modular.
- Optimize your folder structure with index.ts files wherever possible to avoid too many imports.

## Angular Module / Folder Organisation Best Practices

This is a controversial topic depending on which developers / teams and organisations you ask.

I've personally learned over time that as long as the structure is modular, maintainable and as intuitive as possible for everyone then
that's the best compromise.

More on this to come..

## Angular Unit Testing

#### Karma

Official documentation https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html

Karma comes with Angular for your unit tests by default and many coverage and reporting tools are available.

You can also choose to run your unit tests with ChromeHeadless to avoid spinning up a new browser window every time.

#### JEST

Official documentation https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started

Replacing the default karma unit test suite wih Jest can result in many benefits for your application.

https://www.xfive.co/blog/testing-angular-faster-jest/

- Faster (does not require a browser to run the tests)
- Easier to debug as the error messages are less verbose
- The browser is mocked and the tests run in JSDOM instead (much, much faster!)

###### Webpack Bundle Analyzer

The Angular CLI uses webpack in the background to build your application.

You can analyze the static files in your build for a breakdown of exactly what dependencies you have included.

![](https://i2.wp.com/theinfogrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/93f72404-b338-11e6-92d4-9a365550a701.gif?zoom=1.25&resize=848%2C510)

To get started with this tool, install is a dev dependency in your project using your favorite package manager:

```
npm i webpack-bundle-analyzer --save-dev
```

```
yarn add webpack-bundle-analyzer –dev
```

Then, build your application with –stats-json flag:

```
ng build --prod --stats-json
```

And finally, run Webpack Bundle Analyzer against the generated stats.json file located under dist/app-name for angular 6, and dist for angular 5 and below:

```
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/APP-NAME/stats.json
```

Your app name can be found inside your angular.json configuration file.

###### TSLint

You can use this to monitor the code quality of the typescript in your application.

It is highly custmizable with it's set of rules and you can even use other organisation's code standards.

# Databases

## Database Types

#### SQL / RDBMS / Relational databases

RDBMS are more widely known and understood than their NoSQL cousins. Relational databases emerged in the 70’s to store data according to a schema that allows data to be displayed as tables with rows and columns. Think of a relational database as a collection of tables, each with a schema that represents the fixed attributes and data types that the items in the table will have. RDBMS all provide functionality for reading, creating, updating, and deleting data, typically by means of Structured Query Language (SQL) statements.

The tables in a relational database have keys associated with them, which are used to identify specific columns or rows of a table and facilitate faster access to a particular table, row, or column of interest.

Data integrity is of particular concern in relational databases, and RDBMS use a number of constraints to ensure that the data contained in your tables is reliable and accurate.

While there are many relational databases, over time these have become the most popular:

- Oracle - Oracle Database (commonly referred to as Oracle RDBMS or simply as Oracle) is a multi-model database management system produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation.
- MySQL - MySQL is an open source RDBMS based on Structured Query Language (SQL). MySQL runs on virtually all platforms, including Linux, UNIX, and Windows.
- Microsoft SQL Server - Microsoft SQL Server is an RDBMS, that supports a wide variety of transaction processing, business intelligence and analytics applications in corporate IT environments.
- PostgreSQL - PostgreSQL, often simply Postgres, is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance.
- DB2 - DB2 is an RDBMS designed to store, analyze and retrieve data efficiently.

###### Advantages

- Relational databases are well-documented and mature technologies, and RDBMS are sold and maintained by a number of established corporations.
- SQL standards are well-defined and commonly accepted.
- A large pool of qualified developers have experience with SQL and RDBMS.
- All RDBMS are ACID-compliant, meaning they satisfy the requirements of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

###### Disadvantages

- RDBMSes don’t work well — or at all — with unstructured or semi-structured data, due to schema and type constraints. This makes them ill-suited for large analytics or IoT event loads.
- The tables in your relational database will not necessarily map one-to-one with an object or class representing the same data.
- When migrating one RDBMS to another, schemas and types must generally be identical between source and destination tables for migration to work (schema constraint). For many of the same reasons, extremely complex datasets or those containing variable-length records are generally difficult to handle with an RDBMS schema.

#### NoSQL / Non-relational databases

NoSQL databases emerged as a popular alternative to relational databases as web applications became increasingly complex. NoSQL/Non-relational databases can take a variety of forms. However, the critical difference between NoSQL and relational databases is that RDBMS schemas rigidly define how all data inserted into the database must be typed and composed, whereas NoSQL databases can be schema agnostic, allowing unstructured and semi-structured data to be stored and manipulated.

###### Types

Note that some products may fall into more than one category. For example, Couchbase is both a document database and a key-value store.

######## Key-Value Stores

Key-Value Stores, such as Redis and Amazon DynamoDB, are extremely simple database management systems that store only key-value pairs and provide basic functionality for retrieving the value associated with a known key.

The simplicity of key-value stores makes these database management systems particularly well-suited to embedded databases, where the stored data is not particularly complex and speed is of paramount importance.

######## Wide-Column Stores

Wide Column Stores, such as Cassandra, Scylla, and HBase, are schema-agnostic systems that enable users to store data in column families or tables, a single row of which can be thought of as a record — a multi-dimensional key-value store.

These solutions are designed with the goal of scaling well enough to manage petabytes of data across as many as thousands of commodity servers in a massive, distributed system.

Although technically schema-free, wide column stores like Scylla and Cassandra use an SQL variant called CQL for data definition and manipulation, making them straightforward to those already familiar with RDBMS.

######## Document Stores

Document Stores, including MongoDB and Couchbase, are schema-free systems that store data in the form of JSON documents. Document stores are similar to key-value or wide column stores, but the document name is the key and the contents of the document, whatever they are, are the value.

In a document store, individual records do not require a uniform structure, can contain many different value types, and can be nested. This flexibility makes them particularly well-suited to manage semi-structured data across distributed systems.

######## Graph Databases

Graph Databases, such as Neo4J and Datastax Enterprise Graph, represent data as a network of related nodes or objects in order to facilitate data visualizations and graph analytics.

A node or object in a graph database contains free-form data that is connected by relationships and grouped according to labels. Graph-Oriented Database Management Systems (DBMS) software is designed with an emphasis on illustrating connections between data points.

As a result, graph databases are typically used when analysis of the relationships between heterogeneous data points is the end goal of the system, such as in fraud prevention, advanced enterprise operations, or Facebook’s original friends graph.

######## Search Engines

Search Engines, such as Elasticsearch, Splunk, and Solr, store data using schema-free JSON documents. They are similar to document stores, but with a greater emphasis on making your unstructured or semi-structured data easily accessible via text-based searches with strings of varying complexity.

###### Advantages of NoSQL Databases

Since there are so many types and varied applications of NoSQL databases, it’s hard to nail these down, but generally:

- Schema-free data models are more flexible and easier to administer.
- NoSQL databases are generally more horizontally scalable and fault-tolerant.
- Data can easily be distributed across different nodes. To improve availability and/or partition tolerance, you can choose that data on some nodes be "eventually consistent".

###### Disadvantages of NoSQL Databases

These are also dependent on the database type.

- NoSQL databases are generally less widely adopted and mature than RDBMS solutions, so specific expertise is often required.
- There are a range of formats and constraints specific to each database type.

Which database is right for you?

![](https://www.alooma.com/img/cms/moderndb-listforblog.png)

- If ACID (Atomicity, Durability, Consistency, and Durability) compliance is your first priority, consider using RDBMS.
- If you have a massively distributed system and can settle for eventual consistency on some nodes/partitions, you might consider a wide column store such as Cassandra or Scylla.
- If your input data is particularly heterogeneous and difficult to encapsulate according to a normalization schema, consider using a NoSQL DBMS.
- If your goal is to scale vertically, consider an RDBMS; conversely, if you want to scale horizontally, a NoSQL DBMS may be preferable.

## Database Concepts

#### ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability)

ACID properties are an important concept for databases. The acronym stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

###### Atomicity 

The phrase "all or nothing" succinctly describes the first ACID property of atomicity. When an update occurs to a database, either all or none of the update becomes available to anyone beyond the user or application performing the update. This update to the database is called a transaction and it either commits or aborts. This means that only a fragment of the update cannot be placed into the database, should a problem occur with either the hardware or the software involved. Features to consider for atomicity:

a transaction is a unit of operation - either all the transaction's actions are completed or none are
atomicity is maintained in the presence of deadlocks
atomicity is maintained in the presence of database software failures
atomicity is maintained in the presence of application software failures
atomicity is maintained in the presence of CPU failures
atomicity is maintained in the presence of disk failures
atomicity can be turned off at the system level
atomicity can be turned off at the session level

###### Consistency

Consistency is the ACID property that ensures that any changes to values in an instance are consistent with changes to other values in the same instance. A consistency constraint is a predicate on data which serves as a precondition, post-condition, and transformation condition on any transaction.

###### Isolation

The isolation portion of the ACID Properties is needed when there are concurrent transactions. Concurrent transactions are transactions that occur at the same time, such as shared multiple users accessing shared objects. This situation is illustrated at the top of the figure as activities occurring over time. The safeguards used by a DBMS to prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions are a concept referred to as isolation.

As an example, if two people are updating the same catalog item, it's not acceptable for one person's changes to be "clobbered" when the second person saves a different set of changes. Both users should be able to work in isolation, working as though he or she is the only user. Each set of changes must be isolated from those of the other users.

An important point in understanding isolation through transactions is serializability. Transactions are serializable when the effect on the database is the same whether the transactions are executed in serial order or in an interleaved fashion. The effect on the DBMS is that the transactions may execute in serial order based on consistency and isolation requirements. It is important to note that a serialized execution does not imply the first transactions will automatically be the ones that will terminate before other transactions in the serial order.

######## Degrees of isolation:

- degree 0 - a transaction does not overwrite data updated by another user or process ("dirty data") of other transactions
- degree 1 - degree 0 plus a transaction does not commit any writes until it completes all its writes (until the end of transaction)
- degree 2 - degree 1 plus a transaction does not read dirty data from other transactions
- degree 3 - degree 2 plus other transactions do not dirty data read by a transaction before the transaction commits

###### Durability 

Maintaining updates of committed transactions is critical. These updates must never be lost. The ACID property of durability addresses this need. Durability refers to the ability of the system to recover committed transaction updates if either the system or the storage media fails. 

######## Features to consider for durability:

- recovery to the most recent successful commit after a database software failure
- recovery to the most recent successful commit after an application software failure
- recovery to the most recent successful commit after a CPU failure
- recovery to the most recent successful backup after a disk failure
- recovery to the most recent successful commit after a data disk failure 

## Concurrency and Locking

Concurrency control and locking is the mechanism used by DBMSs for the sharing of data. Atomicity, consistency, and isolation are achieved through concurrency control and locking.

While many people may be reading the same data item at the same time, it is usually necessary to ensure that only one application at a time can change a data item. Locking is a way to do this. Because of locking, all changes to a particular data item will be made in the correct order in a transaction.

The amount of data that can be locked with the single instance or groups of instances defines the granularity of the lock. 

#### Granularity Types

- Page Locking
- Cluster Locking
- Class or Table Locking
- Object or Instance Locking

#### Page locking

Page locking (or page-level locking) concurrency control involves all the data on a specific page being locked. A page is a common unit of storage in computer systems and is used by all types of DBMSs. Locking for objects is on the left and page locking for relational tuples is on the right. If the concept of pages is new to you, just think of a page as a unit of space on the disk where multiple data instances are stored.

#### Cluster locking

Cluster locking or container locking for concurrency control means all data clustered together (on a page or multiple pages) will be locked simultaneously. This applies only to clusters of objects in ODBMSs (Object database management systems).

#### Class or Table Locking

Class or table locking means that all instances of either a class or table are locked.

#### Object or Instance Locking

Instance locking locks a single relational tuple in an RDBMS or a single object in an ODBMS


## Database Normalisation

Database normalization is process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and that only those columns which support that topic are included. For example, a spreadsheet containing information about sales people and customers serves several purposes:

- Identify sales people in your organization
- List all customers your company calls upon to sell product
- Identify which sales people call on specific customers.

By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data that is contained within your database, which helps eliminate some issues stemming from database modifications. 

To assist in achieving these objectives, some rules for database table organization have been developed. The stages of organization are called normal forms in database normalisation; there are three normal forms / rules most databases adhere to using.  

As tables satisfy each successive database normalization form, they become less prone to database modification anomalies and more focused toward a sole purpose or topic.

There are three main reasons to normalize a database. 

- 1NF - minimize duplicate data 
- 2NF - minimize or avoid data modification issues 
- 3NF - simplify queries. 

There are several additional forms, such as BCNF, but I consider those advanced, and not too necessary to learn in the beginning.  

The forms are progressive, meaning that to qualify for 3rd normal form a table must first satisfy the rules for 2nd normal form, and 2nd normal form must adhere to those for 1st normal form. Before we discuss the various forms and rules in detail, let’s summarize the various forms:

First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table and each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns.
Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.

## Authentication

#### JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for Authentication

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks: Storing tokens in either local or session storage can lead to XSS attacks. Because of this, it’s a good idea to store tokens in a cookie with httpOnly and secure flags.

#### OAuth

OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. OAuth 2.0 supersedes the work done on the original OAuth protocol created in 2006. OAuth 2.0 focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices. This specification and its extensions are being developed within the IETF OAuth Working Group.

The blockchain is now used in most industries to improve trust and transparency as well as provide an immutable record of distributed data. 

Many people have heard of bitcoin but distributed ledger technology provides potentially more valuable technologies.

- Peer to peer cash (Everyone becomes their own bank)
- Programmable money and universal cash without government inflation.
- Automated brokering
- Removal of third party intermediaries
- Distributed organisations with no central control
- Truly consensus based platform
- Uncensorable data
